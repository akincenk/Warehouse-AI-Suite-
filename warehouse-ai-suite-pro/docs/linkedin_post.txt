Hiring managers and builders in retail/warehouse ops:

I built Warehouse AI Suite (v1) â€” a production-grade FastAPI + Postgres backend for inventory intelligence.
- Real domain tables and migrations
- Low-stock alerts out-of-the-box
- One-command launch with Docker
- Postman collection + seed data
- CI and clean architecture

Repo includes an implementation you can run in minutes and extend to dashboards and optimization.
I am exploring roles where I can ship systems like this at pace.

Demo script and README guide inside the repo.
